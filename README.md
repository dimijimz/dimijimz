# Hi!,my name is Dimitri
### I'm a passionate software development student focused on building innovative and efficient solutions. While honing my skills in Python, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, C#, and Java, Iâ€™m currently developing SaaS projects to showcase my ability to deliver real-world, profitable business solutions. My experience spans web development, AI integration, and software engineering.

## Food Truck Franchise & Entrepreneurship
Over the years, Iâ€™ve started and managed multiple businesses, notably transforming a multi-location gourmet food truck into a successful franchise. I built a fully integrated website featuring online event booking, automated ordering via the Square API, and a QR-based pickup system. Customers at high-traffic NYC events could skip lines, receive notifications when their food was ready, and enjoy a streamlined dining experience, significantly boosting efficiency during peak hours.

## Tesla: Roadside Assistance, Mobile Service, and Leadership
Before transitioning full-time into software, I worked at Tesla near NYC, where I helped launch the Roadside Assistance Program in the Upper NYC/White Plains area. This involved testing and optimizing service zones, using real-world driving data, battery efficiency, and trip planning with Teslaâ€™s Supercharger network. Our data-driven insights even contributed to building a new Supercharger in Yonkers. I then became a Service Technician and later transitioned into Mobile Service, enjoying time on the road while wondering what working from home might be like. I occasionally collaborated with the Mobile Service lead team for NY, advising on regional improvements and supporting broader strategic decisions.

Although I was eventually laid off, that challenging period pushed me to make pivotal life changes, such as returning to college. As well as, renting out my home and relocating to North Carolina in hopes to find somewhere new and more affordable. This move was great for my family and even had us reunite with some of our closest friends. This shift opened doors for my next opportunity: an internship in App Development at Year Up United in Charlotte. Itâ€™s conveniently only a short ride (or walk) from my new apartment!

## Back to College & Ongoing Software Journey
Following the events of my Tesla lay off, I reenrolled in college to pursue my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Software Development at Grand Canyon University, with the goal of landing a role at one of Year Upâ€™s partner companies (e.g., Bank of America, Loweâ€™s Tech Hub, or Wells Fargo). Previously, I interned at Nebula Academy, where I deepened my Python expertise through projects such as:

A text-based dungeon crawler showcasing OOP principles, problem solving, and narrative design (Legend of Zelda: Echoes of the Lost Hero)
Web scraping with BeautifulSoup and Selenium to collect real world data
RESTful API integration, SQL, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Flask for data wrangling and visualization

## Family & Personal Life
Iâ€™m also a proud father to a fun, loving (and often crazy!) 2-year-old son, and Iâ€™m married to my high school best friend, the love of my life. Balancing family, side jobs, college, and internships can be challenging, but itâ€™s helped shape me into the resilient and motivated person I am today.

I believe thereâ€™s no easy or final endpoint to learning in tech, and Iâ€™m eager to continually push my skills, whether for startups or large enterprises.
